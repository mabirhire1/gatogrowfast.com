GatoGrowFast.com is a Marketing  Consulting Company that uses AWS Identity and Access Management resources to grant access to its Staff.

This will be achieved in Two parts. In the first part of the practical, we'll create a policy granting full access to EC2. Then, we'll create a user named Eric and attach that policy to him.

In the second part, we'll create a group and add two more users, Jack and Ade, to that group. Afterward, we'll create a policy for granting full access to EC2 and S3, and attach it to the group.
